# Compiler - Part 3: Project on Language Theory and Compiling (INFO-F403)

This project aims to build a compiler for PASCALMAISPRESQUE, a simple imperative language.
In this third and last part, we generated LLVM code that corresponds to the semantics of the PASCALmaispresque program.


# Compilation
To compile the project into a .jar file, you can use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
make build
```
